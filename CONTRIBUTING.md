# Contributing to ssBartik

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## Filing issues

When filing a bug report, please include a minimal reproducible example
(a [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org)) and the output of
[`sessionInfo()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/sessionInfo.html). For feature
requests, describe the use case and, where it helps, the estimator or
paper you have in mind.

## Pull requests

- Discuss non-trivial changes in an issue first so we agree on the
  approach.

- Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`.

- Keep the package passing `R CMD check`:

  ``` r

  devtools::check()
  ```

- Style: this package follows the tidyverse style guide and ships an
  `.lintr`. Run `lintr::lint_package()` and `styler::style_pkg()` before
  pushing.

- Documentation is generated with roxygen2 — edit the roxygen comments
  in `R/`, then run `devtools::document()`. Do not hand-edit files in
  `man/` or `NAMESPACE`.

- Add a test under `tests/testthat/` for any behaviour change, and a
  bullet to `NEWS.md`.

- New optional dependencies belong in `Suggests` and must degrade
  gracefully — skip with a clear message when the package is not
  installed, the way the AKM / AKM0 path does when `ShiftShareSE` is
  absent.
